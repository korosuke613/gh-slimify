>[!WARNING] 
>`ubuntu-slim` is currently in **public preview** and may change before general availability. 
>Please review GitHub's official documentation for the latest updates and breaking changes.

> [!NOTE]
> At the time of writing, GitHub has not officially published a list of tools pre-installed on `ubuntu-slim` runners. Therefore, the tool detection for missing commands is **uncertain** and based on assumptions. The tool may incorrectly flag commands as missing (false positives) or miss commands that are actually missing (false negatives). Always verify manually before migrating critical workflows.

## 🎯 Motivation

GitHub Actions recently introduced the lightweight `ubuntu-slim` runner (1 vCPU / 5 GB RAM, max 15 min runtime) as a cost-efficient alternative to `ubuntu-latest`. However, manually identifying which workflows can safely migrate is tedious and error-prone:

- ❌ Jobs using Docker commands or containers cannot migrate
- ❌ Jobs using `services:` containers are incompatible
- ❌ Jobs exceeding 15 minutes will fail
- ❌ Container-based GitHub Actions are not supported

**`gh-slimify` automates this entire process**, analyzing your workflows and safely migrating eligible jobs with a single command.

## 📦 Installation

Install as a GitHub CLI extension:

```bash
gh extension install fchimpan/gh-slimify
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All commands must be executed from the **repository root directory** (where `.github/workflows/` is located).

Get help:

```bash
$ gh slimfy --help
```

### Scan Workflows

Scan specific workflow file(s) to find migration candidates:

```bash
gh slimfy .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Or scan multiple workflow files:

```bash
gh slimfy .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/test.yml
```

To scan all workflows in `.github/workflows/`, use the `--all` flag:

```bash
gh slimfy --all
```

**Example Output:**

```
📄 .github/workflows/lint.yml
  ✅ Safe to migrate (1 job(s)):
     • "lint" (L8) - Last execution time: 4m
       .github/workflows/lint.yml:8
  ⚠️  Can migrate but requires attention (1 job(s)):
     • "build" (L15)
       ⚠️  Setup may be required (go), Last execution time: unknown
       .github/workflows/lint.yml:15

✅ 1 job(s) can be safely migrated
⚠️  1 job(s) can be migrated but require attention
📊 Total: 2 job(s) eligible for migration
```

The output shows:
- **✅ Safe to migrate**: Jobs with no missing commands and known execution time
- **⚠️ Can migrate but requires attention**: Jobs with missing commands or unknown execution time
- **Warning reasons**: Displayed in a single line for easy understanding
- **Relative file paths**: Clickable links that work in VS Code, iTerm2, and other terminal emulators

### Auto-Fix Workflows

Automatically update eligible jobs to use `ubuntu-slim`. By default, only safe jobs (no missing commands and known execution time) are updated.

Specify workflow file(s):

```bash
gh slimfy fix .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Or use `--all` to fix all workflows:

```bash
gh slimfy fix --all
```

**Example Output (default - safe jobs only):**

```
Updating workflows to use ubuntu-slim (safe jobs only)...
Skipping 1 job(s) with warnings. Use --force to update them.

Updating .github/workflows/lint.yml
  ✓ Updated job "lint" (L8) → ubuntu-slim

Successfully updated 1 job(s) to use ubuntu-slim.
```

To also update jobs with warnings (missing commands or unknown execution time), use the `--force` flag:

```bash
gh slimfy fix --force
```

**Example Output (with --force):**

```
Updating workflows to use ubuntu-slim (including jobs with warnings)...

Updating .github/workflows/lint.yml
  ⚠️  Updated job "build" (L15) → ubuntu-slim (with warnings)
  ✓ Updated job "lint" (L8) → ubuntu-slim

Successfully updated 2 job(s) to use ubuntu-slim.
```

## 📖 Usage

### Scan All Workflows

To scan all workflows in `.github/workflows/`, use the `--all` flag:

```bash
gh slimfy --all
```

### Using --file Flag

You can also use the `--file` (or `-f`) flag to specify workflow files:

```bash
gh slimfy -f .github/workflows/ci.yml -f .github/workflows/test.yml
```

### Skip Duration Check

Skip fetching job durations from GitHub API. This is useful for:
- **API rate limit management**: Avoid hitting GitHub API rate limits when scanning many workflows
- **Faster scans**: Skip API calls for quicker results
- **When API access is unavailable**: Use when GitHub API is not accessible

```bash
gh slimfy --skip-duration
```

Use the `--verbose` flag to enable debug output, which can help troubleshoot issues with API calls or workflow parsing:

```bash
gh slimfy --verbose
```

### Force Update Jobs with Warnings

Update jobs with warnings (missing commands or unknown execution time):

```bash
gh slimfy fix --force
```

### Combine Options

```bash
gh slimfy fix .github/workflows/ci.yml --skip-duration --force
gh slimfy --all --skip-duration
gh slimfy fix --all --force
```

## 🔍 Migration Criteria

A job is eligible for migration to `ubuntu-slim` if **all** of the following conditions are met:

1. ✅ Runs on `ubuntu-latest`
2. ✅ Does **not** use Docker commands (`docker build`, `docker run`, `docker compose`, etc.)
3. ✅ Does **not** use Docker-based GitHub Actions (e.g., `docker/build-push-action`, `docker/login-action`)
4. ✅ Does **not** use `services:` containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL, etc.)
5. ✅ Does **not** use `container:` syntax (jobs running inside Docker containers)
6. ✅ Latest workflow run duration is **under 15 minutes** (checked via GitHub API)
7. ⚠️ Jobs using commands that exist in `ubuntu-latest` but not in `ubuntu-slim` (e.g. `nvm`) will be flagged with warnings but are still eligible for migration. You may need to add setup steps to install these tools in `ubuntu-slim`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Setup Action Detection**: If a job uses popular setup actions from GitHub Marketplace (e.g., `actions/setup-go`,`hashicorp/setup-terraform`), the commands provided by those actions (e.g., `go`, `terraform`) will **not** be flagged as missing. This is because these setup actions install the necessary tools, making the job safe to migrate. The tool recognizes setup actions from GitHub Marketplace's verified creators, including official GitHub actions and popular third-party actions.

If any condition is violated, the job will **not** be migrated.

### Job Status Classification

Jobs are classified into two categories:

- **✅ Safe to migrate**: No missing commands and execution time is known
- **⚠️ Can migrate but requires attention**: Has missing commands or execution time is unknown

Missing commands are tools that exist in `ubuntu-latest` but need to be installed in `ubuntu-slim` (e.g., `nvm`). These jobs can still be migrated, but you may need to add setup steps to install the required tools.

## 📝 Examples

### Example 1: Simple Lint Job ✅

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm run lint
```

### Example 2: Docker Build Job ❌

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
```

**Result:** ❌ Not eligible — Uses Docker-based action

### Example 3: Job with Services ❌

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:14
    steps:
      - run: npm test
```

**Result:** ❌ Not eligible — Uses `services:` containers

### Example 4: Container Job ❌

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:18
    steps:
      - run: node --version
```

**Result:** ❌ Not eligible — Uses `container:` syntax

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Parse Workflows**: Scans `.github/workflows/*.yml` files and parses job definitions
2. **Check Criteria**: Evaluates each job against migration criteria (Docker, services, containers)
3. **Detect Missing Commands**: Identifies commands used in jobs that exist in `ubuntu-latest` but not in `ubuntu-slim`
4. **Fetch Durations**: Retrieves latest job execution times from GitHub API (unless `--skip-duration` is used)
5. **Classify Jobs**: Separates jobs into "safe" (no warnings) and "requires attention" (has warnings) categories
6. **Report Results**: Displays eligible jobs grouped by status with:
   - Visual indicators (✅ for safe, ⚠️ for warnings)
   - Warning reasons in a single line
   - Relative file paths with line numbers (clickable in most terminals)
   - Execution durations
7. **Auto-Fix** (optional): Updates `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` to `runs-on: ubuntu-slim`:
   - By default: Only safe jobs are updated
   - With `--force`: All eligible jobs (including those with warnings) are updated
